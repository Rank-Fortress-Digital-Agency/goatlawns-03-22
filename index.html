          <p>It’s that time of year again when homeowners across the country are starting to think about hiring a lawn care service to help keep their yards looking nice and tidy. And with so many companies to choose from, it can be tough to decide which one is the best fit for your need. So before you make a decision, here are a few signs that you may need to replace your current lawn care service.</p>

        <h2>Neglecting the lawn</h2>
        <p>If you have been neglecting your lawn, weeds have likely taken over and your grass has turned brown. Weeds thrive in environments where they have easy access to water and sunlight. If you have been neglecting your lawn, the weeds will take over and compete with the grass for resources. Grass needs water, sunlight, and nutrients to stay healthy. If you are not providing your lawn with these things, it will start to turn brown. This is because the weeds will take over and compete with the grass for resources.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>The grass is too long</h2>
        <p>Grass can get out of control if left untreated, making it hard to enjoy the outdoors without being constantly reminded that there’s work that needs doing. A good rule of thumb is looking at the height of blades near fences or trees when deciding whether or not the lawn needs mowing. If they’re taller than 6 inches, it’s time to call a pro.</p>

        <h2>Weeds are taking over your yard</h2>
        <p>Weeds are taking over your yard, and you’re sick of it. You’ve been trying to keep up with the grass cutting yourself, but as soon as you finish one area of the lawn there’s another weed or patch of dry dirt that needs attention. It seems like there’s no end in sight – weeds will always grow back if they have enough time to do so. You need a <em><a style="color:#508d24" href="https://goatlawns.com/lawn-maintenance-waco/"></em>lawn care service</a> that can be proactive in keeping your yard green and healthy without any weeds or patches of dry dirt popping up throughout the seasons.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>You don’t have time to take care of it yourself</h2>
        <p>It’s difficult to find the time to take care of your lawn, and even if you do, it may not look as good as a professional. Lawn care services are available for people who want their yards to be beautifully maintained without having to worry about the work involved. A good company will offer a variety of services including routine maintenance like mowing and trimming trees, weeding flower beds, and removing leaves in fall, along with specialty services like <em><a style="color:#508d24" href="https://goatlawns.com/aeration-waco/">aeration</a></em> or overseeding in spring. Some companies also provide basic gardening skills instruction so that homeowners can maintain their gardens on their own after they leave.</p>

        <h2>The company you’re using doesn’t show up when they say they will</h2>
        <p>As the warm summer months approach, it is time to think about how you want your lawn to look. You may already have a company in mind that does this for you every year or maybe you’ve never hired someone before. The company doesn’t show up when they say they will. If the landscaping service promised a 24-hour response and then failed to show up within 48 hours after an appointment was scheduled, that’s one sign it might be time to find another provider. This can happen with any business but if these instances become more common than not, the odds are high that things won’t get better so it might be time to move on.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>The company doesn’t listen to what you want</h2>
        <p>While you might think that all lawn care companies are the same, that’s not the case. There are specific things you might want to be done to your lawn – like not using chemicals – and if the company you’re working with isn’t listening to what you want, they’re not going to provide the best service. It’s important that the landscaping service understands your needs and can work with you to create a plan that will make both of you happy.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>You want a greener, more eco-friendly lawn</h2>
        <p>One easy way to reduce your environmental impact when caring for your lawn is to switch to an eco-friendly lawn care service. Eco-friendly lawn care services use sustainable practices like using natural fertilizers and pesticides, mulching leaves instead of bagging them, and using manual tools instead of gas-powered ones.</p>
        <p>If you’re looking for an eco-friendly lawn care service, there are a few things to keep in mind. Make sure that the service uses organic or sustainable methods. Second, ask how the service handles waste. Ideally, they will recycle or compost any waste products instead of sending them to a landfill. Finally, ask about the company’s carbon footprint. A good lawn care service will have a low carbon footprint and be working to reduce it even further.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>The company you’re using is too expensive</h2>
        <p>It’s no secret that lawn care services can be expensive, but what you may not know is that there are several ways to save money on your service. One way to do this is by comparing prices between companies. Another way to save money is by evaluating the services you’re getting for your money. You may find that you’re paying for features you don’t need or that you could get cheaper services by combining tasks. Whatever the case, it’s important to be aware of how much you’re spending and what you’re getting in return.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>You’re not happy with the results you’re getting</h2>
        <p>Your lawn is not looking good, and you’re not happy with the results you’re getting. You may be finding that your current service provider just does a “good enough” job, but doesn’t go above and beyond to give you what you want. And maybe they don’t offer all of the services (or types) of care that would make your lawn truly look its best, or take as much time on it as it should.</p>
        <p>If this sounds like something in which case then keep reading! I’m going to talk about some signs that indicate it might be time for a change – from how often your lawn gets cared for, to whether or not there are any services offered at all.</p>
